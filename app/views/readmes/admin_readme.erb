	<h2>Managing Fax Numbers</h2>
	<p>
		The Fax Numbers page displays a table of all fax numbers in the Admin's Phaxio account, the organization that the fax number is linked to, an optional label, the date the fax number was provisioned, the location of the fax number(city/state/province), and whether or not the fax number has a 'callback_url' assigned to it. Fax numbers with an assigned callback_url will not work with Phax Machine. To manage callback_url's assigned to your fax numbers, head over to the <a href="https://console.phaxio.com/phone_numbers">Phone Numbers page</a> in your Phaxio account, and then reload the Fax Numbers page (in Phax Machine) when you're done editing your changes. Fax numbers with an assigned callback_url will be at the bottom of the fax numbers table. Fax numbers that already have a callback_url will be available to add to organizations, however this is not recommended as they will not be functional. In the example below, several fax numbers have already been labeled, and the bottom two numbers have a callback_url.

	</div>

	<p>
		The top of the Fax Numbers page also allows the Admin to provision a new fax number. The Area Code dropdown menu dynamically changes based on the selected State/Province in the menu to the left. Toll-Free numbers are listed as "Non-Geographic" in State/Province.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the Admin desires, they may add a label to any fax number that can only be viewed by the Admin by clicking one of the edit buttons on the right of the table. The Admin can also move the fax number into a different organization by selecting it from the dropdown menu (this will remove all user data linked to the number in its previous organization, and is not recommended), or remove the fax number from its organization.

<div id="managing-organizations" class="col readme-block">
	<h2>Managing Organizations</h2>
	<p>
		Organizations are groups of users and fax numbers set by the Admin. To create an organization, navigate to the Organizations Page ("Organizations" on the navbar) and click the "Add New Organization" button in the top right corner of the screen.

		This page displays all fax numbers that are not assigned to a organization in the "Add fax numbers" table on the left. Please note that fax numbers with a red X next to them already have a primary callback_url will not have fax-to-email capabilities until the callback_url is removed.
	</p>

	<div class="readme-image">
		<%= image_tag("neworganization", width: 700) %>
	</div>

	<p>
		When creating an organization, the Admin checks the box of fax numbers they would like to assign to the organization, gives the organization a name (this name will be seen by the organization's Manager), and decides if the Manager of the organization will be allowed to purchase additional fax numbers. In this example we're creating the "Great Plains LLC" organization, adding all of the fax numbers that are already labeled, and allowing fax numbers to be purchased by the organization. Please note that if an organization is allowed to provision fax numbers, each provisioned fax number will be charged to the Admin's Phaxio account.

		Once an organization has been created, it will appear in the organization page. Each organization's fax numbers and manager (if it has one) are shown. If an organization does not have a manager, a field will be present for inviting a manager, with an additional dropdown menu of fax numbers to set as the manager's caller ID number. In this example we'll invite bob.loblaw@greatplainsllc.com to manage Great Plains LLC.
	</p>

	<div class="readme-image">
		<%= image_tag("organizationindex", width: 1100) %>
	</div>

	<p>
		If an admin would like to edit an organization, they can click on the organization's name, which takes them to a page displaying all of the users linked to a particular fax number. Users may be linked to multiple fax numbers or just one, depending on the use case. When a fax number receives a fax, every person linked to that number will be emailed. To edit the organization, click on the "Manage Great Plains LLC Fax Numbers/Details" in the upper right corner.
	</p>

	<div class="readme-image">
		<%= image_tag("organizationshowadmin", width: 1200) %>
	</div>

	<p>
		In this case we'll simultaneously remove the two fax numbers that have a callback_url, and add the fax number with the 971 area code to this organization.

<div id="changing-logo" class="col readme-block">
	<h2>Changing the Logo</h2>
	<p>
		The Admin may change the site logo (Fast Banana Viral Marketing in this example) by clicking "Edit Profile" in the navigation menu on the left. To change the logo, simply link to the location of the desired logo, input your password, and Phax Machine will add and resize the logo appropropriately. Logos must be an image, and look best when a transparent background is used. The logo is viewed by all users of Phax Machine and is included within all emails sent from Phax Machine.
